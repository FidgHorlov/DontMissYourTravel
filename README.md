# Description
Embark on a delightful adventure where your character is on a time-sensitive mission to catch a flight urgently.
Your key challenge is to skillfully navigate the environment while avoiding interactions with non-player characters (NPCs) to prevent any potential delays. The game offers a comprehensive tutorial that not only eases newcomers into its mechanics but also provides valuable insights and controls for seasoned players. Once you've mastered the basics, the game seamlessly adapts to cater to both novice and experienced players, ensuring an enjoyable experience for everyone.

# PS
This is one of my first projects in Unity, made in ~2019-2020. 

_Please, don't judge for bad coding._
